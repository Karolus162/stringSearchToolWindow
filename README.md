Task #3

To implement task I used Swing instead of jetbrains' equivalent because it was explicitly stated in instructions.
Because of that there may be some warnings/errors inside console while running plugin, but it shouldn't affect the plugin's performance and correctness.

Implementation of Tool Window is in [SearchToolWindowFactory.kt](src/main/kotlin/org/example/searchWindow/SearchToolWindowFactory.kt) and plugin data in [plugin.xml](src/main/resources/META-INF/plugin.xml).
